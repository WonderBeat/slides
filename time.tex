% What is the time?
% Time is a way to order a set of events? % Half life 3
% Einstein Space-Time
% We don't know exactly what the time is
% That's why religions as Zurvanizm apear
% But we take this as ordered
% Okey Falsehoods programmers believe about time
% There are always 24 hours in a day.
% Years have 365 days.
% Ok, that’s not true. But at least the time zone in which a program has to run will never change.
% The system clock will always be set to a time that is not wildly different from the correct local time.
% Time has no beginning and no end. Wiki The Year 2038 problem relates to representing time in many digital systems as the number of seconds passed since 1 January 1970 and storing it as a signed 32-bit binary integer.
% Time stamps will always have the same level of precision.
% A timestamp represents the time that an event actually occurred.
% Minute could be longer than an hour 
% The same month has the same number of days in it everywhere!
% Unix time is the number of seconds since Jan 1st 1970.
% You can wait for the clock to reach exactly HH:MM:SS by sampling once a second.
% The software will never run on a space ship that is orbiting a black hole.
% September 1752 had 19 days in British Empire
% doesn't a month always end in the same year it started? 

% Even JVM and Linux are bad
% Move to distributed system. What is simultanious
% Time-Space relativity
% Cake is lie
% Ok, what we have
% Physical Clocks
% With the timer we can define: simultaneous: all actions that happen between clock ticks before: an operation that happens in a previous clock tick after: an operation that happens in a subsequent clock tick
% Multiple systems - clock skew. On any two given computers, the drift rate will likely differ.
% To solve this problem, clock synchronization algorithms are necessary.
% Clocks sync overview
% Negative time correction?
% It is not important that all processes agree on what the actual time is, but that they agree on the order in which events occur.
% Lampard Clocks - The important contribution of Lamport is that in a distributed system, clocks need not be synchronized absolutely.
% Lampard Happens Before - Defines a relationship called “happens-before”. a -> b is read as “a happens before b” 
% That's how mafia works
% Vector Clocks
% We can use this capability to build a truly distributed dataflow graph with dependencies without having a centralized coordinating process.
% Cassandra
