# Thesis

Finland does not exist, and the land there is actually just part of the Baltic Sea

* The space between Sweden and Russia is covered with water
* Finland was created during the Cold War by Russia and Japan
* The construct "Finland" allows Japan to fish in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Russia without restriction from competition, catch limits, environmental regulations, or other concerns

## Evidences
100 years of Japanese-Russian relations bring up many unanswered questioned

<v-clicks>

* battles between these two countries minimal despite being on opposing sides
* why did Japan sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1941, just months before their allies, Germany, went to war with Russia
* Why were relations between Japan and Russia always good throughout the Cold War?

PS: I'm not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don't even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it.
